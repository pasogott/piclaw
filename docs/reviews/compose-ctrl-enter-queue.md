# Ctrl/Cmd+Enter and unconfirmed drafts

Ctrl/Cmd+Enter now explicitly requests queue-mode submission in both skins. Visual decodes and validates the acknowledgement before clearing the draft; Classic validates before its response callback and uses existing draft restoration on failure. Malformed or empty acknowledgements and rejected requests leave text available and show an error.

The backend queue/admission rules are unchanged: busy targets defer a follow-up, while an idle target may start the accepted input. This fix does not create an idle-only holding queue or change steering persistence.

Full gate ran 9 October 2026 22:12:32–22:24:01 UTC. Head/tree and clean worktree remained unchanged. Wrapper log SHA-256 `ceec4f51a8ea6efef091bf07855db33039c8cf10011970f085dc191dadcfd7c5`. Private exact-source canonical `ci-fast` receipt `7d4ee787-e4a6-4b42-ba5a-c7c1e53fc1a4` passed; aggregate 6,750 passed / 74 skipped / 0 failed across three subprocess summaries. Raw log hash `7268057f01bab2a18594df87004dc393ac2c043d49f6d7620c9cf0f8d7db9c87`. Other receipt capabilities are not-run; browser evidence is separate.

## Regression coverage

Browsers verify Ctrl+Enter during busy and idle status, Cmd+Enter, repeated/previously handled events, a held acknowledgement followed by a newer draft, malformed JSON, empty success payloads, explicit HTTP rejection, queue mode and existing event/ACK deduplication. Focused tests cover modifier/IME guards, positive and rejected acknowledgement shapes, committed relay-source precedence and unchanged atomic queue/routing behaviour.

Two implementation mistakes were caught before qualification: a nonexistent compose-value helper, and calling `preventDefault()` before checking the shortcut's handled-event guard. Failed browser traces are retained under `/workspace/exports/compose-ctrl-enter-*`. Both were corrected and the final rebuilt matrix passed. No deadlines or assertions were weakened. A committed relay-source receipt remains authoritative even when forwarding fails, avoiding an automatic duplicate-source retry.

Publication updates after the frozen gate are docs/receipts only with runtime parity verified. No live prompts, provider requests, production configuration, installation or restart changes. Merge and deployment require separate approval.
